# litefsm Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for `litefsm`, a lightweight finite state machine library for Python.

## Overview

`litefsm` provides a simple and intuitive base class to implement finite state machines (FSMs) in Python. The goal of the library is to provide a minimal yet flexible framework for defining states, events, and transitions between states.

## Features

- Lightweight and easy to use
- Minimal dependencies
- Customisable state machine behaviour through inheritance
